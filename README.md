Detection of Alzheimer's Disease using ResNet152V2

**Alzheimer's disease** is a condition where neurons within the brain stop functioning, lose connection with other neurons and die. It's the most common cause of dementia, a loss of brain function that can adversely impact memory, thinking, language, judgment and behavior. Alzheimer's is irreversible and progressive.

Alzheimer's is evaluated by identifying certain symptoms and ruling out other possible causes of dementia. Your doctor will likely perform a complete medical exam, including neurological, blood and brain imaging exams, such as CT, MRI or PET/CT of the head. There is no cure for Alzheimer's disease. However, your doctor may prescribe medication to slow the disease's progression and manage your symptoms.

**MRI of the head**: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses a powerful magnetic field, radio frequency pulses and a computer to produce detailed pictures of organs, soft tissues, bone and virtually all other internal body structures. MRI can detect brain abnormalities associated with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and can be used to predict which patients with MCI may eventually develop Alzheimer's disease. In the early stages of Alzheimer's disease, an MRI scan of the brain may be normal. In later stages, MRI may show a decrease in the size of different areas of the brain (mainly affecting the temporal and parietal lobes).

## Detection of Alzheimer's Disease

The data consists of MRI images. The data has four classes of images both in training as well as a testing set:

Mild Demented

Moderate Demented

Non Demented

Very Mild Demented

Dataset is available on [Kaggle: Augmented Alzheimer MRI Dataset V2](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uraninjo/augmented-alzheimer-mri-dataset-v2)

**In this Repository**, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based Alzheimer MRI images classification algorithm is developed using **ResNet152V2** architecture, to detect **"Mild Demented"**, **"Moderate Demented"**, **"Non Demented"** and **"Very Mild Demented"** in patient's MRI.
